# A visualisation of data on Mental Health and Music listening

The data comes from a survey created on Kaggle.com in 2022. The data is quantitative and involves a large sample of respondants. I am looking specifically at their favourite music genres, the hours they spend listening to music and their anxiety and depression levels.

The full dataset can be downloaded through this website link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results?select=mxmh_survey_results.csv
The exported dataset can also be found in the 'Data' folder.

The full pdf analysis are in the 'Markdowns' folder.

The r script and descriptions are in the 'Script' folder.

The individual visualisations are in the 'Visualisations' folder.
