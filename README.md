# Data Analysis and Visualisation Project
# PSY6422
# A visualisation of data on Mental Health and Music listening

The data comes from a survey created on Kaggle.com in 2022. The data is quantitative and involves a large sample of respondants. I am looking specifically at their favourite music genres, the hours they spend listening to music and their anxiety and depression scores.

The full dataset can be downloaded through this website link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results?select=mxmh_survey_results.csv

The exported dataset can also be found in the 'Data' folder, along with the codebook.

The project markdowns (Rmd, PDF and HTML) are in the 'Markdowns' folder.

The r script with descriptions is in the 'Script' folder.

Screenshots of the individual (interactive) visualisations are in the 'Visualisations' folder.
